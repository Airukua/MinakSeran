# `Seram(Geser) Tokenizer`

-----

### Project Description

`Seram(Geser) Tokenizer` is a Python library that provides tokenization functionality for the **Seram(geser)** language. This tool is designed to break down Seram(geser) text into smaller units, such as words or sub-words, which is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis.

-----

### Key Features

  * **Efficient Tokenization**: Processes Seram(geser) text quickly and accurately.
  * **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, easy to integrate into your projects.
  * **Easy to Use**: Simple and intuitive API interface.

-----

### Installation

You can install `seram(geser) tokenizer` directly from GitHub using `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Airukua/geser_tokenizer.git@v0.1.0
```

**Note**: It's recommended to install a tagged version (like `@v0.1.0` or the latest stable release) to ensure you get a stable build.

-----

### Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use `seram(geser) tokenizer` in your Python code:

```python
# Import the library
from geser_tokenizer import GeserTokenizer

# Initialize the tokenizer
tokenizer = GeserTokenizer()

# Text in Seram(geser) language
text = "aku nugu ngasana habiba, aku atamari wanu karay."

# Perform tokenization
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)

# Print the results
print(f"Original text: {text}")
print(f"Tokens: {tokens}")

# Another example (if you have other functions, add them here)
# For instance: tokenizer.count_tokens(text)
# print(f"Number of tokens: {tokenizer.count_tokens(text)}")
```

**Expected output (example)**:

```
Original text: aku nugu ngasana habiba, aku atamari wanu karay. 
Tokens: ['aku', 'nugu', 'ngasana', 'habiba', 'aku', 'atamari', 'wanu', 'wanu', 'karay','.']
```

### Enhancements You Can Make:

  * **Images/GIFs (Optional)**: If you have a visual example of the tokenizer in action, a small image or GIF can be very engaging.
  * **Tokenization Details**: Briefly explain your tokenization approach (e.g., is it space-based, does it handle punctuation, does it deal with affixes, etc.). This will be very helpful for more technical users.
  * **API Reference**: If your library has many functions, consider creating an "API Reference" section or linking to separate documentation (e.g., using Sphinx or another tool).
  * **Advanced Examples**: Add more usage examples if there are more complex scenarios.
  * **Tests**: Mention if the project has a test suite and how to run it (if relevant to users).
